# BOND Monitor — Dealer Capacity / Absorption

**Owner:** BOND
**Last Updated:** 2026-05-11 by PROME
**Purpose:** Track whether dealers can absorb Treasury and credit supply without creating funding or duration stress.

## Key Inputs

| Metric | Source | Cadence | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Primary dealer net Treasury positions | NY Fed FR2004 | Weekly | Rising = absorption capacity used; falling under stress = forced de-risking |
| Treasury auction dealer take-down | Treasury auction results | Every auction | High dealer % = weak end demand / warehousing |
| eSLR / SLR rule changes | Fed/OCC/FDIC / news | Event | Capacity relief or constraint |
| Basis trade leverage | CFTC/SEC/Fed reports / market research | Monthly/event | Hidden duration/funding fragility |
| SOFR/repo pressure | LIQUID | Daily | Funding consequence, not BOND-owned |

## Current Read

**🟡 Capacity used, not yet breaking.** Prior refresh had primary dealer net Treasuries around **$550B**, up materially vs 2025, with eSLR relief expanding balance-sheet room. Latest coupon auction dealer takes are not crisis-level, but May 11 3Y dealer take at **13.6%** is not negligible. The May 12 10Y and May 13 30Y will matter more.

## Rolling Table

| Date | Dealer UST position | Auction take-down note | Repo/SOFR context | Read | Source |
|---|---:|---|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-05 refresh | ~$550B net Treasuries | Capacity expanded post-eSLR | SOFR-IORB normalized | 🟡 capacity-used | Prior BOND STATUS / NY Fed/FT note |
| 2026-05-11 3Y | N/A | Dealer accepted 13.6% | SOFR-IORB -5bps | 🟡 watch | FiscalData + dashboard |
| 2026-05-12 10Y | TBD | TBD | See LIQUID | Pending | FiscalData |
| 2026-05-13 30Y | TBD | TBD | See LIQUID | Pending | FiscalData |

## Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Dealer inventories at/near record + weak auctions | Signal LIQUID/ZHAO; watch repo funding |
| Forced inventory decline during selloff | 🔴 market-function stress |
| eSLR relief drives absorption while end-demand weak | Mark as mechanical support, not clean bill of health |
| Weak auction followed by SOFR-IORB positive | Escalate as auction stress funding through repo |
