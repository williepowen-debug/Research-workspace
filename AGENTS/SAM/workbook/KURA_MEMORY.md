# KURA MEMORY

State file for the workbook-librarian sub-agent. Spec is in [`KURA.md`](KURA.md) (durable). This file holds dated state: run history, pending items, standing monitors, calibration.

**Ownership split:**
- **KURA writes** at end-of-run: appends to `## LAST RUN`, adds/removes `## PENDING` items, updates `## STANDING MONITORS`, fills `## NEXT RUN HINTS`. Also fills `## CHANGES SINCE LAST RUN` at the START of each run.
- **SAM writes** `## CALIBRATION` after applying KURA's proposals (it's SAM's view of which patterns held; KURA can't know its own approve/reject rate during its own run).

**Spawn order:** KURA reads `KURA.md` first (spec), then `KURA_MEMORY.md` (state). Spec teaches *what to do*; memory teaches *what's pending and what SAM tends to accept*.

## CHANGES SINCE LAST RUN

*Auto-populated by KURA at run start, based on what's moved in STATUS/TIMELINE/CHANGELOG/PREDICTIONS since the watermark in KURA.md. Cleared at end-of-run.*

*(empty — first KURA_MEMORY entry; next run will populate)*

## LAST RUN

### Run 1 — 2026-06-01 (inaugural, propose-only, Opus 4.8)

**Inputs harvested:** post-watermark = no watermark (inaugural full sweep). Read: STATUS, THESIS v1.5, CHANGELOG, TIMELINE active, PREDICTIONS, TRACKER, research/outputs/, KB.tsv (119 rows), KB_ARCHIVE.tsv, FLOW.tsv, VX.tsv.

**Outputs (all 7 KB adds approved by SAM):**
- KB-SAM-176 (Framework) — Phase 1 inversion under blockade: supply-destruction mechanism
- KB-SAM-177 (Insurer) — J-ICS long-end abandonment: absence is cause, not consequence (v1.4 inversion)
- KB-SAM-178 (Regulatory) — MOF cut super-long JGB issuance to ¥17T (17-yr low)
- KB-SAM-179 (Insurer) — Repack instruments — FX-noise reduction ≠ repatriation
- KB-SAM-180 (Insurer) — Industry foreign-bond allocation 22%→17% (Mar 2021 → Mar 2023)
- KB-SAM-181 (Insurer) — Q4 FY2024 ¥1.35T JGB trim (3rd-largest quarterly on record)
- KB-SAM-182 (Cross-Agent) — Bessent-Katayama Channel 3 affirmation (borderline; SAM kept)

**Archive-moves (2):**
- KB-137 (pre-existing SUPERSEDED — KURA caught it had not been relocated)
- KB-064 (SUPERSEDED via dedup-merge into KB-063; RP-SAM-4 §1 corroborates DEEP_DIVE Exec Summary)

**Palimpsest collapses (2):** KB-065 + KB-066 (hedge ratio rows; resolved to 44.4% authoritative; conflict history pruned to clean provenance).

**FLOW spot-stale fixes (2):** FLOW-JPN-5.02 (USDJPY/CFTC/probs) + FLOW-JPN-6.02 (USDJPY + MOU-break context).

**Watermark advanced:** (none) → 2026-06-01.

**Net workbook math:** KB.tsv 119 → 124 rows; KB_ARCHIVE.tsv 56 → 58 rows. Category integrity preserved.

## PENDING (escalations SAM hasn't yet resolved)

- **Hedge-ratio <30% claim** from Jun 1 news sweep conflicts with KB-065/066 authoritative 44.4%. Source: ainvest.com via Jun 1 sub-agent sweep. Needs primary-source verification before any KB update. Likely source confusion or stale-ratio mix.
- **KB-076 / KB-077 / KB-083 / KB-090 / KB-094 palimpsest collapses** — KURA flagged ripe for collapse but SAM elected to defer until next refresh window.
- **UST denominator gap** (KB-061/062/139/140) — $450B vs $600-810B not closed by FY2025; status-downgrade to ESTIMATE-RANGE pending or pointer-row consolidation.

---

## STANDING MONITORS (surface each run until resolved)

- **JICPA finalization** (KB-108, KB-125) — STATUS CHECK still pending; no FINAL standard reported post comment-close (Mar 17). Base case approval; tail risk neither confirmed nor cleared.
- **Norinchukin Jun FY2025 print** — only remaining near-term Channel 1 reactivation gate. Will trigger FLOW-3.01 refresh + KB-160 PC exposure update if Kitabayashi commentary lands. CLO book reportedly ¥8.2T (was ¥9.7T in thesis) — verify.
- **Mid-tier ESR window** — T&D, Sony Life, Daido, Taiyo prints (late-Jun); consistency check vs Big 3 v1.5 pattern. Explicit foreign-bond reduction language would partially reactivate Channel 1.
- **May TB print Jun 18-19** — Phase 1 inversion diagnostic per THESIS v1.4 (queues against KB-176).
- **FY2026 hedge ratio** — Mar-2026 full-year aggregate not yet released per KB-065/066. Surface when next industry hedge ratio prints.

## CALIBRATION (precision-vs-recall tuning patterns)

*Owned by SAM. Updated after applying each run's proposals.*

### Run 1 (2026-06-01)
- **Approve rate: 7/7 KB adds (100%).** No rejects. Precision-over-recall framing held.
- **KURA's self-bar:** 5 add-candidates excluded as calibration-not-durable (MOU break, Fed-cut path, etc.) — correctly routed to PREDICTIONS/auto-memory per the carve-out. Carve-out is working.
- **Borderline call (KB-182 Bessent-Katayama):** SAM kept. Pattern emerging — single-event-rhetoric is OK when the event has been *promoted* to a thesis-level pillar (here, v1.4 Channel 3). Without that anchor, a single rhetoric event would still be a reject.
- **Dedup acceptance:** Both KURA-proposed dedups (KB-063+064 merge; KB-065/066 collapse) approved. Pattern: SAM accepts dedup/collapse when both rows hold identical resolved facts.
- **Tuning note:** Bias toward precision worked — 7 strong proposals beat 15 marginal ones. Continue this calibration; do NOT loosen the bar.

---

## NEXT RUN HINTS

- **Likely watermark window:** 2026-06-01 → next-run date. Expected post-Jun-16 BOJ resolution will be the heaviest harvest (BOJ decision + Jun 17 FOMC + Jun 18 May TB + Jun 19 National May CPI cluster).
- **Norinchukin Jun FY2025 print** — material Channel 1 re-test gate, watch for the date.
- **MOU walk-back scenario** — if Trump-Khamenei reset → Brent collapse → Phase 2 re-engages → new POV pivot in CHANGELOG worth harvesting.
- **Re-check `## PROPOSED ADDS` queue** against newly-landed rows (currently empty post-Run-1 promotion).
- **Re-verify** the no-change items in KURA brief still hold (hands-off list, category list).
